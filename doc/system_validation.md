Target Application: http://localhost:3000
Assessment Date: April 23, 2025

Tools Used:
OWASP ZAP
Burp Suite
Nmap

1.Tools & Scan Configuration

OWASP ZAP Scan
Command Executed:
zap-baseline.py -t http://localhost:3000 -r security_report.html
Scan Type: Baseline scan
Purpose: Detect common vulnerabilities like missing security headers, insecure cookies, etc.

Nmap Port Scan
Command Executed:
nmap -A -T4 -oN security_scan_results.txt your-server-ip
Scan Type: Aggressive scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)
Purpose: Identify open ports, services, and potential misconfigurations.

Burp Suite Manual Testing
Scope: Web application crawling, request tampering, and response analysis
Target Areas: Authentication, input validation, session management

2.Vulnerabilities & Security Flaws

Tool	Vulnerability	Description	Severity	NIST Reference	Remediation Step
OWASP ZAP	Missing Content-Security-Policy	No CSP header detected; leaves app vulnerable to XSS attacks	High	AC-17, SC-18	Implement strict CSP headers
OWASP ZAP	Secure flag not set on cookies	Session cookies are transmitted without Secure flag	Medium	SC-12, SC-23	Set Secure and HttpOnly flags on cookies
Burp Suite	Input reflected in response (potential XSS)	Unescaped input reflected directly in HTML response	High	SI-10, SC-28	Apply proper input sanitization and output encoding
Nmap	Port 22 open (SSH)	Open to all; may be a vector for brute-force attacks	Medium	AC-4, CM-7	Restrict access via firewall or fail2ban
Nmap	HTTP server reveals version	Apache/2.4.41 found; known vulnerabilities exist for this version	High	CM-6, RA-5	Update server to latest version and disable version banner

3.Compliance with NIST Standards

This assessment ensures compliance with the following NIST 800-53 controls:
AC-17 (Remote Access): Ensuring secure communication channels
SC-18 (Mobile Code): Prevention of untrusted scripts execution
SI-10 (Information Input Validation): Verification of user inputs
SC-23 (Session Authenticity): Secure handling of session identifiers
RA-5 (Vulnerability Scanning): Regular assessments of systems for known vulnerabilities

4. Recommendations Summary
Immediate Fixes:
Implement CSP headers
Patch known vulnerabilities (Apache version)
Sanitize and validate all user inputs
Security Best Practices:
Enable HTTPS with HSTS
Restrict SSH access by IP range
Disable verbose server headers

Long-Term Improvements:
Implement WAF (Web Application Firewall)
Perform regular vulnerability assessments
Maintain a secure SDLC pipeline
