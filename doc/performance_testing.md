# Performance Testing Report

## Overview
This test evaluates how the Flask-based static threat intelligence platform performs under concurrent user traffic using Apache JMeter.

## Tools Used
- Apache JMeter 5.6.3
- Flask dev server running on `localhost:5000`

## Endpoints Tested
- `/`
- `/dashboard/`
- `/about/`

## Test Configuration
- Threads (Users): 100
- Ramp-up Period: 10 seconds
- Loop Count: 10
- Duration: ~1 minute

## Results Summary
| Endpoint     | Success Rate | Errors | Notes               |
|--------------|---------------|--------|---------------------|
| /            | ✅ 100%        | 0%     | Fast load times     |
| /dashboard/  | ✅ 100%        | 0%     | Consistent results  |
| /about/      | ✅ 100%        | 0%     | No failures noted   |

All endpoints successfully handled simulated traffic without failure. Since the application is static HTML, no API or database latency was observed.

## Next Steps
- Future tests should include API endpoints once implemented.
- Consider adding gzip/static caching for frontend optimizations.
