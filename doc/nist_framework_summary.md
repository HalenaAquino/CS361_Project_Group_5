NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 Summary - 

The Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is comprised of 3 main components: 
1. CSF Core: The main component of the CSF. high-level security outcomes that allow the company to manage its cybersecurity risks. The outcomes established in the CSF Core should be easy for all employees regardless of their experience in cybersecurity.
   
    The core has 6 primary functions:
    - GOVERN:   provides the organization's outcomes, strategies, expectations, policies, etc.; goes into detail about what the company can do to achieve the other 5 functions.  
    - IDENTIFY: understanding the cybersecurity risks the company's assets (or the assets of any organization connected to the company) may face. Additionally, it identifies improvement opportunities for the company's policies, processes, etc. 
    - PROTECT: protects the company from cybersecurity risks/threats. Its outcomes are identity management, authentication, and access control; awareness training; data security; platform security; and technology infrastructure resilience. 
    - DETECT: finds and analyzes all cybersecurity attacks and system compromises. 
    - RESPOND: when an incident has been detected, it takes the proper steps to contain, analyze, mitigate, report, and communicate the threat. 
    - RECOVER: restores any assets/operations that were affected by a cybersecurity attack or incident. 
    These functions are then broken down into categories, which are further broken down into        subcategories. These subcategories each have a specific outcome of technical management 
    activities. 
   
2. CSF Organizational Profiles: The component used to describe an organization's current/target cybersecurity status (in terms of the CSF Core's outcomes). Used to understand, adapt, prioritize, and communicate the outcomes given in the core.
   
     Every profile had 1 or both of:
     - Current profile: specifies the outcomes that the company is currently achieving or attempting to achieve. Explains to what extent the outcomes are being achieved.
     - Target profile: describes the company's desired outcomes and cybersecurity objectives. Considers the company's anticipated changes and how they could impact their desired outcomes.
      There are steps needed to create a profile:
        1. Scope the organizational profile
        2. Gather information needed to prepare profile
        3. Create profile
        4. Analyze gaps between the current and target profiles; create an action plan to fill gaps
        5. Implement the action plan and update the profile
     
   
3. CSF Tiers: Applied to CSF profiles; characterize the rigor of the company's risk governance and practices used by management. Can provide context as to how the company views risks and its processes to manage those risks.
   
    The CSF Tiers are:
     1. Partial
     2. Risk Informed
     3. Repeatable
     4. Adaptive

NIST SP 800-37 Risk Management Framework (RMF) - 

The Risk Management Framework (RMF) explains a 7-step process for managing possible information system risks: 
1. Prepare: establish an organizational context, risk tolerance, and resources for the RMF implementation
2. Categorize: define and categorize the system based on impact levels
3. Select: choose the appropriate privacy and security controls
4. Implement: deploy and document the previously selected controls
5. Assess: evaluate the control effectiveness and compliance
6. Authorize: determine if the system is now at an acceptable risk level
7. Monitor: continue to track the risks, effectiveness, and compliance.
